    <h2>Assignment One</h2>
    <p>Given an array of numbers, assume that they are all different. Calculate the largest difference (subtraction) between any two numbers of the array.
      <ol>
        <li>Code in Javascript 2 solutions for this problem</li>
        <li>Explain which one is better than the other one.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>To solve this problem, I thought the most important task would be finding the largest and smallest value within the array, and then subtracting the two to return the difference. My immediate thought was to sort the array. This led to the first function, <code>sortBiggestDiff</code> . </p>
    <p>The next thought I had when thinking of the problem was pulling the max and min values from the array using the Math object, which led to the second function, <code>mathBiggestDiff</code> .</p>
    <p>A fascinating discovery when running tests in the console for the two functions I created, I learned more about the <code>Sort</code> Function in Javascript. Accodrding to Mozilla: </br></br>
    <code> The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array. The sort is not necessarily stable. The default sort order is according to string Unicode code points. Optionally, you can pass a SortingFunction which specifies a function that defines the sort order. If omitted, the array is sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value, according to the string conversion of each element. </code></br><br>
    Because the inputs are going to be numbers, it's going to be important that the array is sorted by numerical value, not unicode order, so I added a sorting function to the first solution.</p>
    <p>Seeing this, I'd argue that the Max and Min solution is the best to go with. the Math solution is more stable, and can handle larger sets of arrays.</p>

    <h2>Assignment Two</h2>
    <p>Create a function that takes two rectangles as parameters and returns true if the rectangles intersect, false otherwise. Assume that the (0,0) of the axis is the top left. (This is actually how iOS positions views in the screen). So a rectangle with origin (0,0), width 10 and height 20 would be on the top left corner taking 10 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Starting with this challenge, I thought about my recent learnings about SVGs and the rect object. I wanted to be able to see this implemented and used in a case where you're using SVGs to plot rect objects, and getting notified if you're overlapping. From there, I thought through coordinate geometry, and created the <code>rectIntersect</code> function. I spent a moment to confirm that I couldn't define the function with a ? being so used to that convention with creating boolean methods in ruby. Despite that itch, I moved forward with the logic. </p>
    <p>This function was challenging because Jacascript doesn't utilize ranges, which is what I wanted to use to determine if the coordinates ranges compared, but I decided to visualize the coordinates, and break down what comparison I needed to make. If you're starting from the top left of a screen, the starting coordinates from the second rectangle have to at least be within range of eachother, secondarily, checking if the rectangle reaches to intersect. I used the following examples to determine truth or false in my tests: </p>
    <div>
      <h4>Example Rectangles Uno y Dos</h4>
      <svg width="400" height="400" viewBox="0 0 400 400">
        <rect x="0" y="0" width="50" height="100" stroke="#56A000" stroke-width="4" fill="white" />
        <rect x="20" y="40" width="50" height="180" fill="white" stroke="blue" stroke-width="4"/>
      </svg>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Example Rectangles Tres Y Cuatro</h4>
      <svg width="400" height="400" viewBox="0 0 400 400">
        <rect x="0" y="0" width="120" height="100" stroke="purple" stroke-width="4" fill="white" />
        <rect x="200" y="200" width="50" height="100" fill="white" stroke="orange" stroke-width="4"/>
      </svg>
    </div>
    <p>Additional cases that are not defined are around whether it should be true if the second rectangle sits inside of, or covers the other rectangle. </p>
  </div>

    <h2>Assignment Three</h2>
    <p>Given the function <code> assignment3 </code> that calculates a number from a string:
    <ul>
      <li>Find the string for which the number is: 667734139064<li>
      The string has 7 characters and it can have repeated chars. The strings has to be formed with the characters:</br>
      <code>"a","c","d","e","g","i","l","m","n","o","p","r","s","t","u","w".</code>
      <li>What does the code do?</li>
      Given a String formed with any of the above characters, assignment3 function returns an Int64 for that String.For example the string leepdag has the hash number of 680131662011 . Please use the assingment3 function to see if you have the correct answer.
    </br>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>I went on a bit of a rabbit hole determining why an int64 was being used, then after that, I looked at the code line by line, and looked at what was happening. A way i like to debug is to use console log to see what's being done inside a function as it runs, so I ran the function a few times, using 1, 3, 5, then 7 letter words. </p>

    <p>Starting with "a", i got the following from playing in the console: </p></br>
    <div>
    <code>assignment3("a")</br>
      "H starts as: 7"</br>
      "the letter I'm working on is: a"</br>
      "the index you find this letter in our alphabet is: 0"</br>
      "H is changed to: 259"</br>
      259</br>
      7*37</br>
      259</br>
      assignment3("aa")</br>
      "H starts as: 7"</br>
      "the letter I'm working on is: a"</br>
      "the index you find this letter in our alphabet is: 0"</br>
      "H is changed to: 259"</br>
      "the letter I'm working on is: a"</br>
      "the index you find this letter in our alphabet is: 0"</br>
      "H is changed to: 9583"</br>
      9583</br>
      9583/37</br>
      259</br>
      </code>
      </div>
      <p>Starting with this in mind, I came up with the following ideas for cracking the code:
      <ul>
        <li>translating the letter array to their index. NOTE: the letters go to 15</li>
        <li>remove 7 * 37 from the number since it's the first iteration?</li>
        <li>Would there be a way to reduce the number similar to the square root using 37?</li>
        <li>Seeing each iteration of the numbers shows the similarities in results of H at each letter, perhaps I could divide the number by 37 and determine what range of number it could be reduced between 0 and 15 (the index of the letter) </li>
        <li>if i hold "aaaaaaa" as the base number, and see what the difference is, it could give me an idea of what letters are used.</li>
      </ul>
      Coming from my brainstorm, and reviewing what's going on with the console log when i put in certain letters, I learned that with each letter I used, the result between one letter to the next was only one number! Knowing that, I was able to divide the number we need to convert by 37, seven times, and determine from the first letter in the alphabet array what letter followed, till I discovered that CORRECT was the magic word! SUCCESS!</p>
      <p>As excited as I was to have figured out the word, I felt it had to be done using code. So, Looking at how I solved it, I decided to make a function that would take the same steps. Breaking down each step, I was able to build a function that parced out the number as each letter is encrypted, to determine the amount of letters, then reverse-engineer each number to determine the letter!</p>
