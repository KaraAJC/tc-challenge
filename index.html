  <h1>Assignment One</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <p>Given an array of numbers, assume that they are all different. Calculate the largest difference (subtraction) between any two numbers of the array.
    <ol>
      <li>Code in Javascript 2 solutions for this problem</li>
      <li>Explain which one is better than the other one.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>To solve this problem, I thought the most important task would be finding the largest and smallest value within the array, and then subtracting the two to return the difference. My immediate thought was to sort the array. This led to the first function, <code>sortBiggestDiff</code> . </p>
  <p>The next thought I had when thinking of the problem was pulling the max and min values from the array using the Math object, which led to the second function, <code>mathBiggestDiff</code> .</p>
  <p>A fascinating discovery when running tests in the console for the two functions I created, I learned more about the <code>Sort</code> Function in Javascript. Accodrding to Mozilla: </br></br>
  <code> The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array. The sort is not necessarily stable. The default sort order is according to string Unicode code points. Optionally, you can pass a SortingFunction which specifies a function that defines the sort order. If omitted, the array is sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value, according to the string conversion of each element. </code></br><br>
  Because the inputs are going to be numbers, it's going to be important that the array is sorted by numerical value, not unicode order, so I added a sorting function to the first solution.</p>
  <p>Seeing this, I'd argue that the Max and Min solution is the best to go with. the Math solution is more stable, and can handle larger sets of arrays.</p>
