    <h1>TangoCodeChallenges by Kara Carrell</h1>

    <h2>Assignment One</h2>
    <p>Given an array of numbers, assume that they are all different. Calculate the largest difference (subtraction) between any two numbers of the array.
      <ol>
        <li>Code in Javascript 2 solutions for this problem</li>
        <li>Explain which one is better than the other one.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>To solve this problem, I thought the most important task would be finding the largest and smallest value within the array, and then subtracting the two to return the difference. My immediate thought was to sort the array. This led to the first function, <code>sortBiggestDiff</code> . </p>
    <p>The next thought I had when thinking of the problem was pulling the max and min values from the array using the Math object, which led to the second function, <code>mathBiggestDiff</code> .</p>
    <p>A fascinating discovery when running tests in the console for the two functions I created, I learned more about the <code>Sort</code> Function in Javascript. Accodrding to Mozilla: </br></br>
    <code> The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array. The sort is not necessarily stable. The default sort order is according to string Unicode code points. Optionally, you can pass a SortingFunction which specifies a function that defines the sort order. If omitted, the array is sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value, according to the string conversion of each element. </code></br><br>
    Because the inputs are going to be numbers, it's going to be important that the array is sorted by numerical value, not unicode order, so I added a sorting function to the first solution.</p>
    <p>Seeing this, I'd argue that the Max and Min solution is the best to go with. the Math solution is more stable, and can handle larger sets of arrays.</p>

    <h2>Assignment Two</h2>
    <p>Create a function that takes two rectangles as parameters and returns true if the rectangles intersect, false otherwise. Assume that the (0,0) of the axis is the top left. (This is actually how iOS positions views in the screen). So a rectangle with origin (0,0), width 10 and height 20 would be on the top left corner taking 10 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down.</p>

    <p>Starting with this challenge, I thought about my recent learnings about SVGs and the rect object. I wanted to be able to see this implemented and used in a case where you're using SVGs to plot rect objects, and getting notified if you're overlapping. From there, I thought through coordinate geometry, and created the <code>rectIntersect</code> function. I spent a moment to confirm that I couldn't define the function with a ? being so used to that convention with creating boolean methods in ruby. Despite that itch, I moved forward with the logic. </p>
    <p>This function was challenging because Jacascript doesn't utilize ranges, which is what I wanted to use to determine if the coordinates ranges compared, but I decided to visualize the coordinates, and break down what comparison I needed to make. If you're starting from the top left of a screen, the starting coordinates from the second rectangle have to at least be within range of eachother, secondarily, checking if the rectangle reaches to intersect. I used the following examples to determine truth or false in my tests: </p>
    <div>
      <h4>Example Rectangles Uno y Dos</h4>
      <svg width="400" height="400" viewBox="0 0 400 400">
        <rect x="0" y="0" width="50" height="100" stroke="#56A000" stroke-width="4" fill="white" />
        <rect x="20" y="40" width="50" height="180" fill="white" stroke="blue" stroke-width="4"/>
      </svg>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Example Rectangles Tres Y Cuatro</h4>
      <svg width="400" height="400" viewBox="0 0 400 400">
        <rect x="0" y="0" width="120" height="100" stroke="purple" stroke-width="4" fill="white" />
        <rect x="200" y="200" width="50" height="100" fill="white" stroke="orange" stroke-width="4"/>
      </svg>
    </div>
    <p>Additional cases that are not defined are around whether it should be true if the second rectangle sits inside of, or covers the other rectangle. </p>
